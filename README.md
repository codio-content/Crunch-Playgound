**A place to experiment with your own Crunch files**

This Unit is not a teaching Unit. It's main purpose is to allow students to add and run their own Crunch projects. 

- The public GitHub repository for this unit can be found at [https://github.com/codio-content/Crunch-Playground](https://github.com/codio-content/Crunch-Playground).

## Creating a new Crunch project
To create a new Crunch project, please follow these steps.

1. Select the 'File' menu item at the top of this page.
1. Select 'New File' from the drop down menu.
1. In the dialog that appears, locate the 'File Name' field.
1. Enter 'newfilename.crunch' in this field, where 'newfilename' is a name you choose for your file. 
1. Press 'OK' and the new project should appear.

It is important that whatever file name you choose has the extension '.crunch'. This is how Codio knows to create a Crunch project.

## Closing a Crunch project
You can close a Crunch project at any time. You don't need to save it as Crunch projects are saved automatically.

## Opening an existing Crunch project
To open a Crunch project, look over to the left. You will see any Crunch projects listed there. 

Click on the file to open it and start editing.
